# Pyviz_homework

This homework asked us to create several visualizations and combine them all into a single dashboard. This required initial coding to set up the visualizations (rental_analysis_1) and additional steps to create an interactive panel with these graphs (dashboard). One of the things to highlight was my need to transform the original visualizations into _plotly.express_ format to combine them into a single dashboard.
